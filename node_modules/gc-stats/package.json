This can grow if usedHeap needs more.\n* usedHeapSize: Number of bytes in use by application data\n* total HeapExecutableSize: Number of bytes for compiled bytecode and JITed code\n* heapSizeLimit: The absolute limit the heap cannot exceed\n* pause: Nanoseconds from start to end of GC using hrtime()\n* pauseMS: pause expressed in milliseconds\n\ngctype can have the following values:\n* 1: Scavenge (minor GC)\n* 2: Mark/Sweep/Compact (major GC)\n* 3: Both 1 and 2\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install gc-stats\n",
